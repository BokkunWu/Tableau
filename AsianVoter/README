Created an infrographic using Tableau to raise awareness of the lack of voter turn out in the Asian American community.  
The data was sourced from the US census, years 2012 and 2016. I transformed and filtered the data using a series of VLOOKUPs nested within INDEX MATCH functions. 
The final product gained over 1,500+ views through various social media platforms.
